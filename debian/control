Description: HPL
 A Portable Implementation of the High-Performance Linpack Benchmark for
 Distributed-Memory Computers
 .
 HPL is a software package that solves a (random) dense linear system in
 double precision (64 bits) arithmetic on distributed-memory computers.
 It can thus be regarded as a portable as well as freely available
 implementation of the High Performance Computing Linpack Benchmark.
